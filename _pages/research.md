## [Valuing Primary Schools in Urban China](https://emmazai.github.io/files/paper1.pdf)

with [Jimmy Chan](https://jimmyhingchan.weebly.com/), [Zhi Wang](http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/wangzhi2013brownecon/), [Qinghua Zhang](http://crm.gsm.pku.edu.cn/psc/CRMPRD/EMPLOYEE/CRM/s/WEBLIB_SPE_ISCT.TZ_SETSPE_ISCRIPT.FieldFormula.IScript_SpecialPages?TZ_SPE_ID=118) and Xian Fang, _Journal of Urban Economics_, January 2020

We study the effect of school quality on housing prices in urban China. Our objective is to provide an estimate of the school quality premium based on the best available data. To account for unobserved neighborhood characteristics, we adopt the boundary-discontinuity design of Black (1999) and the matching strategy proposed by Fack and Grenet (2010). The results suggest that parents value public primary schools that have outstanding records in academic tournaments. The school-quality premium is highly non-linear. While a tournament superstar—a school above the 90th percentile in tournament performance—causes housing prices in its neighborhood to increase by 14 percent, or about 430,000 RMB ($ 60,648), the price difference between non-superstar schools is small.

## The Effect of Informal Caregiving on Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from Medicaid Aging Waivers 

This paper provides evidence that Medicaid aging waivers increase caregiving hours for intensive caregivers and diminishes their labor market performance. I collect Medicaid aging waiver spending for each state from year 1995 to 2014, which I combine with Health and Retirement Study (HRS) public and restricted geographic data on informal caregiving and labor market details of respondents and state of residence of their parents. I exploit exogenous variation in Medicaid aging waiver spending resulting from the unique design of aging wavier application which predicts the enrollment and expenditures for the future years. Conditional on total Medicaid home and community based services (HCBS) resources, the waiver spending variations across years and states generate policy-induced exogeneity. I find that conditional on total HCBS spending, Medicaid waiver spending increases caregiving hours for intensive caregivers and has negligible effect on less intensive or non-caregivers, thus deteriorating labor market outcomes for intensive caregivers. The results show that caregiving has inertia and Medicaid aging waiver helps intensive caregivers care more and doesn’t facilitate non-caregivers turning into caregivers.

## Racial/Ethnic Differences in the Distribution of Wealth in the United States (with Sherman Hanna and Kyoung Kim)

This study examines racial/ethnic differences in the distribution of wealth in the United States. Extended from previous studies on racial/ethnic wealth gap, we use quantile regression models and focus on the distribution. Using rich information contained in the new 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, we find that the median net worth of White households is almost 10 times the median net worth of Black households and over 8 times the median net worth of Hispanic households.  Also, Black households have lower mean net worth than Hispanic households while Asian/other households have lower median but higher mean net worth than White households. We conduct a quantile regression on the Inverse Hyperbolic Sine (IHS) transformation of net worth. At the mean levels of control variables, younger Hispanic households have higher net worth than comparable White households, while older Hispanic households have lower net worth than comparable White households.

## Individual Differences and Saving Behavior Among Low-Income Individuals (with Caezilia Loibl)

Saving has been demonstrated as an important tool to get rid of poverty. However, saving among low-income individuals is quite low. This paper studies such saving behavior for those who participated in one government program Individual Development Account (IDA). The goal of IDA program is to help low-income people save and gain self-sufficiency. The data is from field study and collected of these IDA participants across six cities. We find that liquidity constraints may not fully explain savings deposits of IDA program takers. Our data further show that time preference is the key to predict saving deposits. A stronger orientation toward future is positively associated with a higher chance to save. The findings help policymakers better understand the saving incentives among low-income individuals and inform the design of community-based savings programs.
