## [Valuing Primary Schools in Urban China](https://emmazai.github.io/files/paper1.pdf)

We study the effect of school quality on housing prices in urban China. Our objective is to provide an estimate of the school quality premium based on the best available data. To account for unobserved neighborhood characteristics, we adopt the boundary-discontinuity design of Black (1999) and the matching strategy proposed by Fack and Grenet (2010). The results suggest that parents value public primary schools that have outstanding records in academic tournaments. The school-quality premium is highly non-linear. While a tournament superstar—a school above the 90th percentile in tournament performance—causes housing prices in its neighborhood to increase by 14 percent, or about 430,000 RMB ($ 60,648), the price difference between non-superstar schools is small.

## The Effect of Informal Caregiving on Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from Medicaid Aging Waivers 

This paper provides evidence that Medicaid aging waivers increase caregiving hours for intensive caregivers and diminishes their labor market performance. I collect Medicaid aging waiver spending for each state from year 1995 to 2014, which I combine with Health and Retirement Study (HRS) public and restricted geographic data on informal caregiving and labor market details of respondents and state of residence of their parents. I exploit exogenous variation in Medicaid aging waiver spending resulting from the unique design of aging wavier application which predicts the enrollment and expenditures for the future years. Conditional on total Medicaid home and community based services (HCBS) resources, the waiver spending variations across years and states generate policy-induced exogeneity. I find that conditional on total HCBS spending, Medicaid waiver spending increases caregiving hours for intensive caregivers and has negligible effect on less intensive or non-caregivers, thus deteriorating labor market outcomes for intensive caregivers. The results show that caregiving has inertia and Medicaid aging waiver helps intensive caregivers care more and doesn’t facilitate non-caregivers turning into caregivers.
