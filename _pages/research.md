## [Valuing Primary Schools in Urban China](https://emmazai.github.io/files/Value primary schools in urban China.pdf)

with [Jimmy Chan](https://jimmyhingchan.weebly.com/), [Zhi Wang](http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/wangzhi2013brownecon/), [Qinghua Zhang](http://crm.gsm.pku.edu.cn/psc/CRMPRD/EMPLOYEE/CRM/s/WEBLIB_SPE_ISCT.TZ_SETSPE_ISCRIPT.FieldFormula.IScript_SpecialPages?TZ_SPE_ID=118) and Xian Fang, _Journal of Urban Economics_, January 2020

We study the effect of school quality on housing prices in urban China. Our objective is to provide an estimate of the school quality premium based on the best available data. To account for unobserved neighborhood characteristics, we adopt the boundary-discontinuity design of Black (1999) and the matching strategy proposed by Fack and Grenet (2010). The results suggest that parents value public primary schools that have outstanding records in academic tournaments. The school-quality premium is highly non-linear. While a tournament superstar—a school above the 90th percentile in tournament performance—causes housing prices in its neighborhood to increase by 14 percent, or about 430,000 RMB ($ 60,648), the price difference between non-superstar schools is small.

## Racial/Ethnic Differences in the Distribution of Wealth in the United States (with Sherman Hanna and Kyoung Kim)

This study examines racial/ethnic differences in the distribution of wealth in the United States. Extended from previous studies on racial/ethnic wealth gap, we use quantile regression models and focus on the distribution. Using rich information contained in the new 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, we find that the median net worth of White households is almost 10 times the median net worth of Black households and over 8 times the median net worth of Hispanic households.  Also, Black households have lower mean net worth than Hispanic households while Asian/other households have lower median but higher mean net worth than White households. We conduct a quantile regression on the Inverse Hyperbolic Sine (IHS) transformation of net worth. At the mean levels of control variables, younger Hispanic households have higher net worth than comparable White households, while older Hispanic households have lower net worth than comparable White households.

## Individual Differences and Saving Behavior Among Low-Income Individuals (with Caezilia Loibl)

Though saving is important to many families in poverty, it can appear to be an insurmountable task in the context of day-to-day efforts to make ends meet. To help low-income households gain self-sufficiency and build wealth, the U.S. Congress initiated the Individual Development Account (IDA) program in 1998. This study examines survey data of 668 participants in the IDA program to investigate psychological factors that influence savings behavior. In particular, we propose, based on findings in the behavioral economics literature, that liquidity constraints may not fully explain savings deposits of IDA program participants and hypothesize that psychological factors, especially time preference, may also influence savings behavior. Survey data show that for our sample of IDA program participants, a stronger orientation toward the future is associated with a higher ability to save. The findings help policymakers better understand the saving incentives among low-income individuals and inform the design of community-based savings programs.
