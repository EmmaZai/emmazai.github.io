## [Valuing Primary Schools in Urban China](https://emmazai.github.io/files/Value primary schools in urban China.pdf)

with [Jimmy Chan](https://jimmyhingchan.weebly.com/), [Zhi Wang](https://zhiwang2013brownecon.weebly.com/), [Qinghua Zhang](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=zhangq) and Xian Fang, _Journal of Urban Economics_, January 2020

We study the effect of school quality on housing prices in urban China. Our objective is to provide an estimate of the school quality premium based on the best available data. To account for unobserved neighborhood characteristics, we adopt the boundary-discontinuity design of Black (1999) and the matching strategy proposed by Fack and Grenet (2010). The results suggest that parents value public primary schools that have outstanding records in academic tournaments. The school-quality premium is highly non-linear. While a tournament superstar—a school above the 90th percentile in tournament performance—causes housing prices in its neighborhood to increase by 14 percent, or about 430,000 RMB ($ 60,648), the price difference between non-superstar schools is small.

## [The Unintended Effect of Medicaid Aging Waivers on Informal Caregiving](https://emmazai.github.io/files/jmp_draft.pdf)

(with Yinan Liu) (under review)

Medicaid aging waivers incentivize older adults who need long-term care to stay at home
rather than move into a nursing facility. However, this policy may inadvertently shift care
burdens onto informal caregivers. Using data on state-level waiver expenditures from 1998 to
2014 linked with the restricted access Health and Retirement Study (HRS), this paper
investigates whether program funding is associated with the probability that an HRS
respondent provides informal care to her older parents. Changes to state-level policy funding
produce a quasi-experiment, which allows us to use two-way ﬁxed eﬀects models to estimate a
causal relationship between the program and informal caregiving. The ﬁndings show that a 10
percent increase in aging waiver expenditures increases the overall likelihood that an adult
child becomes an informal caregiver to her parents by 0.1 percentage points (0.3 percent). The
overall estimate is composed of diﬀerential eﬀects on diﬀerent types of care. The results show
that the Medicaid aging waiver funding is positively associated with the likelihood of being an
errands caregiver and a non-intensive caregiver who spends fewer hours providing care, but
unrelated to the likelihood of providing personal care and intensive care. The ﬁndings are
mainly driven by the mechanism that aging-at-home is more attractive supported by the aging
waivers.

## [The Effect of Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services on Health Outcomes](https://emmazai.github.io/files/chapter3_dis.pdf) 

(with Yinan Liu) (under review)

The Medicaid Home and Community- Based Services (HCBS) program in the
United States subsidizes the long-term care provided at home or in community-based
settings for older adults. Little is known about how HCBS aﬀects the well-being of
the aging population. Using detailed information about health from the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS) linked with state-level HCBS policy expenditures, we show
that HCBS indeed helps older people avoid institutionalization and stay at home
longer. Furthermore, the program is positively associated with the probability of
older individuals reporting better mental health, especially among people with
limited resources.
