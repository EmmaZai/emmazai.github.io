## The Unintended Effect of Medicaid Aging Waivers on Informal Care

Medicaid aging waivers aim to incentivize older adults who need long-term care to stay at home and age in place. This policy might affect the informal caregiving decisions provided by family members. Specifically, I focus on individuals' caregiving behavior towards their older parents and provide the first empirical study on whether Medicaid aging waivers affect the composition of care and caregivers. I utilize the Medicaid aging waiver expenditures for each state from 1998 to 2014 and link them with the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data based on the state of residence of individuals' parents. The unique design of Medicaid aging waivers provides a quasi-experiment on the timing of funding change of this program which allows me to use difference-in-differences to identify its causal estimates on informal care.  I compare the informal care outcomes in treated states in the years when they change the funding level of Medicaid aging waivers and that of control states with no change in funding of this policy. The findings show that a 10 percent increase in Medicaid aging waiver funding increases the likelihood of an adult child becoming an informal caregiver by .4 percentage point. This effect is larger on caregivers who provide errands assistance, by .6 percentage point. The effect of Medicaid aging waivers on caregivers who offer personal care is negative and the magnitude is .3 percentage point. The Medicaid aging waiver affects non-intensive caregivers most and have a limited effect on intensive caregivers. Moreover, this policy affects female and male caregivers almost equally.

We study the effect of school quality on housing prices in urban China. Our objective is to provide an estimate of the school quality premium based on the best available data. To account for unobserved neighborhood characteristics, we adopt the boundary-discontinuity design of Black (1999) and the matching strategy proposed by Fack and Grenet (2010). The results suggest that parents value public primary schools that have outstanding records in academic tournaments. The school-quality premium is highly non-linear. While a tournament superstar—a school above the 90th percentile in tournament performance—causes housing prices in its neighborhood to increase by 14 percent, or about 430,000 RMB ($ 60,648), the price difference between non-superstar schools is small.

## The Effect of Informal Caregiving on Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from Medicaid Aging Waivers 

This paper provides evidence that Medicaid aging waivers increase caregiving hours for intensive caregivers and diminishes their labor market performance. I collect Medicaid aging waiver spending for each state from year 1995 to 2014, which I combine with Health and Retirement Study (HRS) public and restricted geographic data on informal caregiving and labor market details of respondents and state of residence of their parents. I exploit exogenous variation in Medicaid aging waiver spending resulting from the unique design of aging wavier application which predicts the enrollment and expenditures for the future years. Conditional on total Medicaid home and community based services (HCBS) resources, the waiver spending variations across years and states generate policy-induced exogeneity. I find that conditional on total HCBS spending, Medicaid waiver spending increases caregiving hours for intensive caregivers and has negligible effect on less intensive or non-caregivers, thus deteriorating labor market outcomes for intensive caregivers. The results show that caregiving has inertia and Medicaid aging waiver helps intensive caregivers care more and doesn’t facilitate non-caregivers turning into caregivers.
