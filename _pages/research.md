## [Valuing Primary Schools in Urban China](https://emmazai.github.io/files/Value primary schools in urban China.pdf)

with [Jimmy Chan](https://jimmyhingchan.weebly.com/), [Zhi Wang](https://zhiwang2013brownecon.weebly.com/), [Qinghua Zhang](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/conjsxq.jsp?urltype=tree.TreeTempUrl&wbtreeid=1099&user_id=zhangq) and Xian Fang, _Journal of Urban Economics_, January 2020

We study the effect of school quality on housing prices in urban China. Our objective is to provide an estimate of the school quality premium based on the best available data. To account for unobserved neighborhood characteristics, we adopt the boundary-discontinuity design of Black (1999) and the matching strategy proposed by Fack and Grenet (2010). The results suggest that parents value public primary schools that have outstanding records in academic tournaments. The school-quality premium is highly non-linear. While a tournament superstar—a school above the 90th percentile in tournament performance—causes housing prices in its neighborhood to increase by 14 percent, or about 430,000 RMB ($ 60,648), the price difference between non-superstar schools is small.

## [The Unintended Effect of Medicaid Aging Waivers on Informal Caregiving](https://emmazai.github.io/files/jmp_draft.pdf)

(with Yinan Liu) (under review)

Medicaid aging waivers incentivize older adults who need long-term care to stay at home
rather than move into a nursing facility. However, this policy may inadvertently shift care
burdens onto informal caregivers. Using data on state-level waiver expenditures from 1998 to
2014 linked with the restricted access Health and Retirement Study (HRS), this paper
investigates whether program funding is associated with the probability that an HRS
respondent provides informal care to her older parents. Changes to state-level policy funding
produce a quasi-experiment, which allows us to use two-way ﬁxed eﬀects models to estimate a
causal relationship between the program and informal caregiving. The ﬁndings show that a 10
percent increase in aging waiver expenditures increases the overall likelihood that an adult
child becomes an informal caregiver to her parents by 0.1 percentage points (0.3 percent). The
overall estimate is composed of diﬀerential eﬀects on diﬀerent types of care. The results show
that the Medicaid aging waiver funding is positively associated with the likelihood of being an
errands caregiver and a non-intensive caregiver who spends fewer hours providing care, but
unrelated to the likelihood of providing personal care and intensive care. The ﬁndings are
mainly driven by the mechanism that aging-at-home is more attractive supported by the aging
waivers.

## [The Benefits of Medicaid Home and Community- Based Services on Health](https://emmazai.github.io/files/chapter3_dis.pdf) 

(with Yinan Liu) 

 The Medicaid Home and Community- Based Services (HCBS) program in the United States subsidizes the long-term care provided at home or in community-based settings for older adults. Little is known about how HCBS affects the well-being of the aging population. Using detailed information about health from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) linked with state-level HCBS policy expenditures, we show that HCBS is beneficial to improve general health outcomes of older individuals. Our results find that HCBS generosity is positively associated with the probability of older individuals self-reporting better health status, mitigating functional mobility limitations, showing better emotional feelings, and increasing cognitive skills. In addition, these health benefits of HCBS differ across groups by resources and demographic characteristics. 
 
## [The Effect of the Partnership Long-Term Care Insurance Program on Private Insurance and Employment](https://emmazai.github.io/files/pltc_employment.pdf) 

(with Yinan Liu) 

The Partnership Long-Term Care Insurance (PLTC) program protects
policyholders an amount of assets, equivalent with the value of insurance,
from Medicaid asset requirement. The public-private PLTC program draws
mixed ﬁndings about its cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we extend current
discussion by exploring the effect of the partnership program on employment,
which is little investigated in the literature. Using detailed individual
information from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from 2000 to 2014
linked with state-level PLTC roll-out information, we ﬁrst ﬁnd that the PLTC
increases private LTC insurance coverage by 1 to 2 percentage points. In
addition, the PLTC program increases the probability of nearly-elderly
individuals (45-65) to work full-time by 3 to 7 percentage points. To better
understand the unintended labor market effects, we propose a theoretical
model based on the ”bequest motive” channel. Empirical evidence conﬁrms
the theoretical prediction that the effect is mainly driven by individuals with
strong bequest motive who have children and are in well-paid jobs.
