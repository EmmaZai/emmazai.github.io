## [Valuing Primary Schools in Urban China](https://emmazai.github.io/files/Value primary schools in urban China.pdf)

We study the effect of school quality on housing prices in urban China. Our objective is to provide an estimate of the school quality premium based on the best available data. To account for unobserved neighborhood characteristics, we adopt the boundary-discontinuity design of Black (1999) and the matching strategy proposed by Fack and Grenet (2010). The results suggest that parents value public primary schools that have outstanding records in academic tournaments. The school-quality premium is highly non-linear. While a tournament superstar—a school above the 90th percentile in tournament performance—causes housing prices in its neighborhood to increase by 14 percent, or about 430,000 RMB ($ 60,648), the price difference between non-superstar schools is small.

## [The Unintended Effect of Medicaid Aging Waivers on Informal Caregiving](https://emmazai.github.io/files/JMP_EmmaZai.pdf)

Medicaid aging waivers provide funding for in-home formal care to seniors. Their aim is
to incentivize older adults who need long-term care to stay at home rather than move into
a nursing facility. However, this policy may inadvertently shift care burdens onto informal
caregivers, who would not otherwise be required to care for family members were they to enter
nursing homes. In this paper, I test whether in-home formal care subsidized by Medicaid aging
waivers is a substitute or complement for informal care provided by adult children to their
parents. Using data on state-level Medicaid aging waiver expenditures from 1998 to 2014 linked
with the restricted access Health and Retirement Study (HRS), I investigate whether program
funding is associated with the probability that an HRS respondent provides informal care to her
older parents. Changes to state-level policy funding produce a quasi-experiment, which allows
me to use two-way fixed effects models to estimate a causal relationship between the program
and informal caregiving. My findings reveal that a 10 percent increase in Medicaid aging waiver
expenditures increases the overall likelihood that an adult child becomes an informal caregiver
to her parents by 0.1 percentage points (0.3 percent). The overall estimate is composed of
differential effects on different types of care. While policy expenditures are positively related
to the likelihood of providing help with errands, they are negatively related to the likelihood
of providing help with personal care (a more intensive form of caregiving). I also find that
the Medicaid aging waiver funding is positively associated with the likelihood of being a nonintensive
caregiver who spends fewer hours providing care, but unrelated to the likelihood of
providing intensive care. Moreover, only female caregivers reduce caregiving for personal care.
The results show that non-intensive informal care is a complement for in-home formal care,
and provide the first empirical evidence on the effect of the Medicaid aging waivers on the
composition of care received by older Americans.

## Racial/Ethnic Differences in the Distribution of Wealth in the United States (with [Sherman Hanna](https://u.osu.edu/hanna.1/) and [Kyoung Tae Kim](http://ktkim.people.ua.edu/))

This study examines racial/ethnic differences in the distribution of wealth in the United States. Extended from previous studies on racial/ethnic wealth gap, we use quantile regression models and focus on the distribution. Using rich information contained in the new 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances, we find that the median net worth of White households is almost 10 times the median net worth of Black households and over 8 times the median net worth of Hispanic households.  Also, Black households have lower mean net worth than Hispanic households while Asian/other households have lower median but higher mean net worth than White households. We conduct a quantile regression on the Inverse Hyperbolic Sine (IHS) transformation of net worth. At the mean levels of control variables, younger Hispanic households have higher net worth than comparable White households, while older Hispanic households have lower net worth than comparable White households.

## Individual Differences and Saving Behavior Among Low-Income Individuals (with [Caezilia Loibl](https://ehe.osu.edu/human-sciences/directory/?id=loibl.3))

Though saving is important to many families in poverty, it can appear to be an insurmountable task in the context of day-to-day efforts to make ends meet. To help low-income households gain self-sufficiency and build wealth, the U.S. Congress initiated the Individual Development Account (IDA) program in 1998. This study examines survey and savings deposit data of 668 participants in the IDA program. This work, which is part of a larger research study, investigates psychological factors that influence savings behavior. In particular, we estimate the influence of psychological factors, especially time preference, on savings behavior. We find that a stronger orientation toward the future is associated with a higher ability to save. The findings help policymakers better understand the saving incentives among low-income individuals and inform the design of savings programs.
