School attendance zones
======
Each April, the department of education publicizes school-address attendance rules. Each school encompasses a list of addresses which are the attendance zone. In general, school attendance zones are adjacent. The top and bottom graphs represent a snapshot of the attendance zones while the middle graph lays out the full picture of attendance zones in one city of China.
