About me
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Ohio State University. I am an applied microeconomist with interests in the economics of aging, education and health economics. I use large secondary datasets and research designs to estimate the causal effects of public policy on individual behavior and outcomes. My work is motivated by understanding how government interventions affect individual wellbeing and how individuals respond to public policy. 

I am on the job market during the 2020-2021 academic year. I will be available for interviews at the 2020 EEA Job Market, the 2020 CICE Annual Meeting, and the 2021 AEA/ASSA  Annual Meeting. 

Job market paper
======
My job market paper is about the long-term care in the United States and studies the informal caregiving affected by Medicaid aging waiver programs.
Medicaid aging waivers provide funding for in-home formal care to seniors. Their aim is
to incentivize older adults who need long-term care to stay at home rather than move into
a nursing facility. However, this policy may inadvertently shift care burdens onto informal
caregivers, who would not otherwise be required to care for family members were they to enter
nursing homes. In this paper, I test whether families respond to Medicaid aging waivers by
increasing or reducing informal caregiving.
