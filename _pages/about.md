About me
======
I am a research scientist at the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR)](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en) and the [Max Planck â€“ University of Helsinki Center for Social Inequalities in Population Health](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/helsinki-institute-demography-and-population-health/maxhel-center).
My research centers on the intersections of aging, long-term care, health disparities, and health policy, with a strong focus on improving overall well-being. Utilizing large-scale secondary, registry, and administrative datasets, I aim to answer critical questions that inform health policies and drive equitable care solutions. My work spans the following key areas:

Aging behavior/LTC policy and formal/informal care/wellbeing of older population
======
* Examine how long-term care (LTC) policies in US influence both formal and informal caregiving by family members 
* Examine how LTC programs in US affects the well-being of older adults aging in place 
* Examine how grandchild care provision affects health outcomes of grandparents
* Examine how widowhood among older individuals affects their mental health
* Examine how opioids exposure affects the wellbeing of the aging population
* Policies: Medicaid home- and community- based services (HCBS), Partnership Long-Term Care Insurance (PLTC)
* Datasets: Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (public and restricted), Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), CMS HCBS data

SES inequality in cancer patient outcomes
======
* Describe different patterns of inequality in diagnosis, treatment, and mortality by education, income, urban/rural, occupation, geography among cancer patients in Finland
* Explore the factors that drive these inequality patterns
* Policies: education reform, cancer screening policies 
* Datasets: Finnish registry data, cancer screening data 

Effectiveness of health insurance in developing countries
======
* Assess the impact of health insurance policies on healthcare use and health outcomes in China
* Evaluate the effectiveness of LTC insurance on the quality of life 
* Policies: Long-term care insurance, New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) 
* Datasets: China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), public health yearbooks, administrative hospital data

Structural racism in early life and well-being across the life course
======
* Comprehensive exploration of the historical dimensions and contemporary repercussions of structural racism in US
* Policies: discrimination and antidiscrimination laws, hospital desegregation  
* Datasets: Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (public and restricted), Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), discrimination data 
  

<!--My research interests are the economics of aging and health economics. I use large secondary datasets and research designs to estimate the causal effects of public policy on individual behavior and outcomes. My work is motivated by understanding how government interventions affect individual wellbeing and how individuals respond to public policy. -->
