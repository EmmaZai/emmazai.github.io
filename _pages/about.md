I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Ohio State University. I am an empirical economist with interests in economics of aging, education and health economics. My research ranges from studying educational contexts in China to pressing aging issues in the United States.

I am on the job market during the 2020-2021 academic year. I will be available for interviews at the 2020 EEA Job Market, 2020 CICE Annual Meeting, and the ASSA 2021 Annual Meeting.
