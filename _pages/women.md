GWIE is a graduate student-led organization dedicated to the advancement of women in all stages of economic research and helping women 
in Ph.D programs make connections and succeed. GWIE is a group by women, for women, dedicated specifically to those undertaking Ph.Dâ€™s in economics and 
related fields. As these disciplines still do not have a large female presence, we aim to build a 
strong support network for women to exchange experiences, research ideas, and the professional opportunities that are crucial to our success and well-being.

I served as GWIE Co-Founder have been part of GWIE's Leadership since 2018.
