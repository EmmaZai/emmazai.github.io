Medicaid Home or Community-Based Services HCBS
======
Historically, Medicaid funded long-term care (LTC) only in institutional settings such
as nursing homes for older people and for people with conditions such as cognitive
disabilities, physical disabilities, mental health disabilities, and disabling chronic
diseases. With costly nursing home care, Medicaid LTC expenditures increased
significantly over the years. To contain the massive growth in LTC expenditures and
satisfy the public's preference for LTC at home or in their communities, starting in the
early 1980s, Medicaid implemented the Home or Community-Based Services (HCBS)
program. The Medicaid HCBS mainly funds three programs that constitute the majority
of its enrollment and spending: a mandatory home health state plan, an optional
personal care state plan, and optional waivers. The Medicaid HCBS state plans are
available to every Medicaid-eligible person with limited resources. Medicaid optional
waivers allow states to waive general requirements in regular Medicaid programs, such as
Medicaid state plan programs. For example, Medicaid waivers can select a particular
population to serve, set limits on participants, and expand coverage through generous financial requirements that are not allowed in regular Medicaid programs. Medicaid
waivers "waive" these requirements to realize the specific purpose of these programs.
