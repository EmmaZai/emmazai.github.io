## The Effect of Informal Caregiving on Labor Market Outcomes: Evidence from Medicaid Aging Waivers 


This paper provides evidence that Medicaid aging waivers increase caregiving hours 
for intensive caregivers and diminishes their labor market performance. 
I collect Medicaid aging waiver spending for each state from year 1995 to 2014, 
which I combine with Health and Retirement Study (HRS) public and restricted geographic 
data on informal caregiving and labor market details of respondents and state of residence of 
their parents. I exploit exogenous variation in Medicaid aging waiver spending resulting from the 
unique design of aging wavier application which predicts the enrollment and expenditures for the future years. 
Conditional on total Medicaid home and community based services (HCBS) resources, the waiver spending variations 
across years and states generate policy-induced exogeneity. I find that conditional on total HCBS spending, 
Medicaid waiver spending increases caregiving hours for intensive caregivers and has negligible effect on less
intensive or non-caregivers, thus deteriorating labor market outcomes for intensive caregivers. 
The results show that caregiving has inertia and Medicaid aging waiver helps intensive caregivers care more and 
doesnâ€™t facilitate non-caregivers turning into caregivers.
