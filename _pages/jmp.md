## The Unintended Effect of Medicaid Aging Waivers on Informal Care

Medicaid aging waivers provide funding for in-home care to seniors. Their aim is to
incentivize older adults who need long-term care to stay at home rather than moving into a
nursing facility. However, this policy may inadvertently shift care burdens onto informal
caregivers, who would not otherwise be required to care for family members were they to enter
nursing home care. In this paper, I test whether informal care is a substitute or compliment
for in-home formal care. Specifically, I test whether the Medicaid aging waiver program causes
individuals to become informal caregivers for their older parents. Using data on state-level
Medicaid aging waiver expenditures from 1998 to 2014 linked with the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS), I test whether program funding is associated with the probability that an HRS
respondent provides informal care to their older parent. Changes to state-level policy funding
produces a quasi-experiment, which allows me to use two-way fixed effects models to test for a
causal relationship between the program and informal caregiving. My findings reveal that a 10
percent increase in Medicaid aging waiver expenditures increases the overall likelihood that an
adult child becomes an informal caregiver to her parent by 0.1 percentage points (0.3 percent).
The overall estimate is composed of differential effects on different types of care. While policy
expenditures are positively related to the likelihood of providing help with errands, they are
negatively related to the likelihood of providing help with personal care (a more intensive form
of caregiving). I also find that the Medicaid aging waiver funding is positively associated with
the likelihood of being a non-intensive caregiver who spends fewer hours providing care, but
unrelated to the likelihood of providing intensive care. Moreover, female caregivers respond to
the policy more strongly than male caregivers. The results show that non-intensive informal
caregiving is a compliment to in-home formal care, and provide the first empirical evidence on
the effect of the Medicaid aging waivers on the composition of care received by older
Americans.
