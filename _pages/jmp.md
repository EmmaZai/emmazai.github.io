## The Unintended Effect of Medicaid Aging Waivers on Informal Care

Medicaid aging waivers aim to incentivize older adults who need long-term care to stay at home and age in place. This policy might affect the informal caregiving decisions provided by family members. Specifically, I focus on individuals' caregiving behavior towards their older parents and provide the first empirical study on whether Medicaid aging waivers affect the composition of care and caregivers. I utilize the Medicaid aging waiver expenditures for each state from 1998 to 2014 and link them with the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) data based on the state of residence of individuals' parents. The unique design of Medicaid aging waivers provides a quasi-experiment on the timing of funding change of this program which allows me to use difference-in-differences to identify its causal estimates on informal care.  I compare the informal care outcomes in treated states in the years when they change the funding level of Medicaid aging waivers and that of control states with no change in funding of this policy. The findings show that a 10 percent increase in Medicaid aging waiver funding increases the likelihood of an adult child becoming an informal caregiver by 0.10 percentage point (0.3 percent). This effect is larger on caregivers who provide errands assistance, by 0.16 percentage point (0.5 percent). The effect of Medicaid aging waivers on caregivers who offer personal care is negative and the magnitude is 0.07 percentage point (0.8 percent). The Medicaid aging waiver affects non-intensive caregivers most and have a limited effect on intensive caregivers. Moreover, this policy affects female and male caregivers almost equally.
